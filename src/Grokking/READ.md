## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure that operates on the principle of Last-In, First-Out (LIFO),
meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.

- Operations:
  - **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack 0(1)
  - **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of the stack 0(1)
  - **Peek**: Get the top element of the stack 0(1)
  - **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty 0(1)
  - **isFull**: Check if the stack is full 0(1)
  - **Size**: Get the number of elements in the stack 0(1)
  - **Search**: Search for an element in the stack 0(n)
  - **Clear**: Remove all elements from the stack 0(n)
- Implementing Stack using:
  - **Array**
  - **Linked List**
- Applications:
  - Memory management
  - Expression evaluation
  - Function calls
  - Undo mechanisms
  - Backtracking
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
