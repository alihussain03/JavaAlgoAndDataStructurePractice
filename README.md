## Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique where you build a solution step-by-step, undoing steps if you reach an invalid state. You
explore possible paths and backtrack when needed. It's often used for problems like permutations, combinations, and
pathfinding.

### Types of Backtracking

#### Depth-First Search (DFS): Explore as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explore all possible paths level by level, backtracking when necessary.

#### Pruning: Cut off paths that won't lead to a valid solution early, reducing search space.
